            <p>To create this project, we will first start by extracting data using python, the Nasdaq itself allows us to, in one click, download historical CSV data as far back as we wish. We will split this into different arrays, such as opening and closing data, the Volume, as well as daily highs and lows. Following this is the analytics. Using Linear Regression, as well as basic machine learning, we will be able to make basic predictions as to whether a stock will appreciate or depreciate. I will consider this to be a success if the project is successful more than 60% of the time, as that is roughly the point where it is useful and capable of delivering consistent profit. At this point I will create an interactive information system </p>
