				<p>The idea of predicting stock markets has intrigued researchers and financial analysts
					for decades. Notably, in 1973, economist Burton Malkiel posited in his book "A
					Random Walk Down Wall Street" that stock prices follow a “random walk”, which
					means that fluctuations are random, and cannot be predicted solely by analysing
					past price movements. This hypothesis challenged conventional technical analysis
					and spurred further investigation into market behaviour. My project aims to test this
					hypothesis by leveraging modern data analytics and machine learning techniques to
					analyse stock market data, specifically focusing on the Nasdaq index.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="paragraph2" class="Container">
				<p>My interest in stock market prediction was initially sparked while investigating
				Bitcoin’s volatile price fluctuations. However, Bitcoin's up-to-date value and historical
				data are often locked behind APIs, limiting accessibility for analysis. In contrast, the
				Nasdaq offers a free API that allows users to download historical data from any point
				in time. This accessibility makes the Nasdaq an ideal candidate for this project, as it
				ensures that all datasets are publicly available, free, and can be thoroughly analysed.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="paragraph3" class="Container">
				<p>Much of the inspiration for the design of this project came from existing analytical solutions,
					such as Apple's Stocks app for iOS, because of its real-time market data, Yahoo Finance, 
					because of its use of API's and the Nasdaq itself, because of its excellent candlestick charts. These
					platforms provide valuable insights into market trends and investor behaviour. My goal is to take the analysis
					a step further by testing the validity of Malkiel's hypothesis. By employing advanced statistical models, and machine
					learning algorithms, I aim to determine whether patterns and trends can be identified that could potentially forecast
					future price movements</p>
			</div>
			<div id="paragraph4" class="Container">
				<p>This project aligns closely with the field of financial analytics, a branch of
					mathematics that has led to highly lucrative careers in finance and investment
					banking. By diving into this project, I will gain practical experience in data analysis,
					statistical modelling, and machine learning, all of which are crucial skills for a career
					in Data Science and Analytics—a field I am considering studying next year.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="paragraph5" class="Container">
				<p>This project not only allows me to explore a fascinating area of financial mathematics
					but also serves as a practical stepping stone toward my future studies in Data
					Science and Analytics. With publicly available datasets. I am eager to put Malkiel's
					hypothesis to the test and potentially uncover hidden patterns in the Nasdaq stock
					market.</p>
