					<p>This project is likely to have a complex file structure and complex function calls, it is likely a flowchart will be needed to keep up with it. Similarly, I will create a mindmap, in order to keep track of the file structure.</p>

					<p>In this section, I intend to discuss the structure of the project as well as the technologies
						used throughout. My aim is to build an interactive information system that analyses stock
						data.</p>
					<p>My project should align closely with the requirements set out in the brief.</p>
					<p>There are two different NodeJS “projects” within this project. One, a UI frontend built
					using the react framework, and Plotly. And a backend server, built using ExpressJS
					and Mongoose, it also handles and executes all the Python Scripts. Mostly, I really
					wanted to keep only one project, and this worked great for a long time. Until I had to
					submit form data. It was at that point it became clear a second server was needed.
					React projects are client-side, and unable to interact with either local files, or
					databases. The proper way to handle this is to send data from the frontend to an
					API, and from there to the hosted database. This is how the server functions.</p>
					<p>The project will consist of two NodeJS applications:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>A frontend UI built using ReactJS and Plotly for interactive data visualisations.</li>
						<li>A backend server using ExpressJS and Mongoose, which will handle API requests
							and execute Python scripts for stock data analysis.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>ReactJS uses JSX, which simplifies building dynamic, interactive stock visualisations. It will integrate Javascript and HTML elements seamlessly.</p>
					<p>Initially, I intended to keep everything within one NodeJS project. However, since React is
						client-side and cannot directly access local files or databases, I will create a separate
						backend server to handle stock data processing as well as data storage. This backend will
						manage form submissions, handle Python scripts and API requests. It will connect the
						frontend with a hosted database.</p>

				<div class="Container" id="p1">
					<h3>NodeJS for Backend</h3>
					<p>For the backend, I have chosen NodeJS for the following reasons:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Portability – It will allow the examiner to run the project on their computer. Provided they have the necessary libraries</li>
						<li>Performance – NodeJS is highly efficient for fetching stock data and rendering graphs.</li>
						<li>Full-Stack Compatibility – It will ensure that both the backend and frontend usecompatible JavaScript technologies.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="Container"id="p2">
					<h3>Why not Flask?</h3>
					<p>While Flask was considered, I decided against it for the following reasons:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>More setup required – Flask requires a virtual environment, making it less portable.</li>
						<li>Slower execution – Flask is not as optimised for real-time stock data processing.</li>
						<li>Incompatibility with JavaScript – The form in the advanced requirements must use JavaScript, which would not be natively possible with Flask.</li>
					</ul>

			<div id="regtext" class="Container">
				<p>Since stock market trends are unpredictable, I will use linear regression to analyse historical
					stock data. This will be done by calculating slope-based predictions over varying timeframes.
					This will help to visualise stock trends and estimate whether prices are likely to rise, or fall
					based on historical data. To complete and visualise these calculations, I have planned some
					pseudocode (See “Create” Section for a further explanation) to demonstrate how the
					regression models will work in Python.</p>
