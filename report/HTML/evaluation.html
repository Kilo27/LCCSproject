				<p>This project meets the key requirements by collecting and cleaning stock data, analyzing
					trends, and allowing user interaction. It successfully integrates real-time data retrieval,
					interactive graphs, and a user-friendly interface, making stock data more accessible and
					easier to understand.
				</p>
				<p>
					That said, there are areas where things could be improved. One big challenge I faced was
					predicting stock prices accurately. Burton Malkiel’s Random Walk theory suggests that stock
					prices can’t be reliably predicted from past trends alone, and my project confirmed that.
					While the regression models give a general idea of trends, they aren’t always reliable.
				</p>
				<p>
					A more advanced approach would be to incorporate AI-driven sentiment analysis, where an
					algorithm could analyze financial news and reports to detect patterns that influence stock
					prices. I initially considered using SpaCy, a Python NLP library, for this, but time constraints
					meant I couldn’t develop or train a machine learning model in time.
				</p>
				<p>Another issue is how stock data is handled. Right now, the project:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Fetches stock data from the NASDAQ API.</li>
					<li>Converts it from JSON to CSV.</li>
					<li>Uses the CSV data for graphing.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					This works fine for development, but React can’t handle local file storage well in production.
					If multiple users accessed the site at once, the system wouldn’t work as expected. When this
					was tested on 2 devices at once, both users receives the same data. Its current format only
					allows for one user at a time. A better approach would be storing stock data in a cloud
					database, just like how user predictions are stored. This would improve performance,
					scalability, and reliability.
				</p>
				<p>Future Improvements</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Implement AI-driven sentiment analysis for more accurate stock predictions.</li>
					<li>Migrate stock data storage to a cloud-based database.</li>
					<li>Enhance the React UI to display real-time stock updates.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Overall, while the project works well, these improvements would make it more scalable,
					accurate, and user-friendly.</p>
