					<p>This project is likely to have a complex file structure and complex function calls, it is likely a flowchart will be needed to keep up with it. Similarly, I will create a mindmap, in order to keep track of the file structure.</p>

					<p>There are two different NodeJS “projects” within this project. One, a UI frontend built
					using the react framework, and Plotly. And a backend server, built using ExpressJS
					and Mongoose, it also handles and executes all the Python Scripts. Mostly, I really
					wanted to keep only one project, and this worked great for a long time. Until I had to
					submit form data. It was at that point it became clear a second server was needed.
					React projects are client-side, and unable to interact with either local files, or
					databases. The proper way to handle this is to send data from the frontend to an
					API, and from there to the hosted database. This is how the server functions.</p>

					<p>An important part of this project is JSX, this is an extension of normal JavaScript,
						and it allows for the HTML you see in most JavaScript files in the project. It shares
						features of both a programming language, and a markup language, allowing for a
						“best of both worlds” situation when trying to create dynamic, updating webpages.</p>

					<p>For the backend I have chosen to use NodeJS, there were a few main reasons for this. Firstly NodeJS is portable, meaning that an examiner can run the project on their own computer, provided they have the libraries installed. Secondly it is extremely performant. NodeJS has an extremely efficient way of rendering, that far outpaced the competition. And finally, it made it extremely easy to create both the back, and frontend of the project with compatible technologies</p>

				<div class="Container"id="nodeideal">
					<p>NodeJS is ideal for operations such as:</p>
					<ol type="a">
						<li>Fetching live stock data</li>
						<li>Rendering interactive visualisations, (when combined with Plotly and ReactJS)</li>
					</ol>

				<p>I have also considered Flask as an alternative, however there were a few reasons why I did not chose to use it. Firstly there is much more setup required, you are supposed to use a python virtual environment, and importing libraries is somewhat more complex. Secondly, because we need to use a virtual environment, it would not have been portable at all. Thirdly, it is far slower, and far less efficient. And finally, in the advanced requirements, it is specified the form must be created with JavaScript, and this would not have been possible with Flask, because it is a Python environment</p>

				<p>The regression lines in this project will be somewhat complicated. So, in order to visualise them better I have created some pseudocode you can see to the right, in order to better understand how it will work</p>

				<p>Function slopefunction(all x values, all y values):</p>
				<p style="text-indent:20px;">Number of elements on x axis</p>
				<p style="text-indent:20px;">Get the mean of both axis</p>
				<p style="text-indent:20px;">If mean equals 0 for x, return 0,0 to avoid divide by zero error</p>
				<p style="text-indent:20px;">Calculate covariance of x and y</p>
				<p style="text-indent:20px;">Calculate xovariance of x</p>
				<p style="text-indent:20px;">Calculate slope (m=covariance of x and y, divided by covariance of x)</p>
				<p style="text-indent:20px;">Y Intercept equals mean of y minus the slope times the mean of x</p>
				<p style="text-indent:20px;">return slope and Y Intercept</p>
				<p>Plot the regression line using the number of values in the x-axis, the starting point of the regression line, the y-intercept, and the slope</p>
